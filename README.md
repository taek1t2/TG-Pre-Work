## When we hit https://www.techtonicgroup.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions.

//How the page layout is built:
Creating an HTMl format, organizing the content into section, where they're going to be shown and laid out throughout the page, then "painting" the page with CSS. The DOM (document object model) shows the content and CSSOM (cascade stylesheet object model) shows the styling. Javascript plays the role when the user needs to create a specific function in the web page, for example when a user is going to provide the information under the contact response nav-bar: it requires a specific function of importing and exporting data or information and holds that data into another computer. The buttons on the main page also directs to another webpage, which displays a different content.

ex) The 'talk to us' button leads to a different page where a user can provide information on the right section of the page.

## From start to finish how does that data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

The user enters the IP address on the browser and the address connects to the server. If it sent to the server without any problems, it would respond to the client.

## What code is rendered in the browser?

Hypertext Markup Link or HTML; when it display its content.

## What is the server-side code’s main function?

Gives or responds the information. Both client and server use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to communicate each other.

## What is the client-side code’s main function?

Asks or requests the information. Both client and server use HTTP to communicate to each other.

## How many instances of the client-side assets (HTML, CSS, JS, Images, etc.) are created?

Once.

## How many instances of the server-side code are available at any given time?

Once, whenever the client request the information or data that they need.

## What is runtime?

It is when the program is running or being executed. In some languages, there are built-in or packaged libraries, where these programs have a set routine.

## How many instances of the the databases connected to the server application are created?

Each time given. In an object-oriented programming (OOP), an instance is a specific realization of any object called instantiation. Each time the program starts or runs, it's the run-time of that instance.
