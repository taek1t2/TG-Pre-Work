## When we hit https://www.techtonicgroup.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions.

When the user views the webpage, the layout shows two sections and each have different sets of columns and rows. On the top right hand corner where a user would view all the options is called responsive nav-bars, which lead to another page filled with different contents. The buttons on the main page also directs to another webpage.

ex) The 'talk to us' button leads to a different page where a user can provide information on the right section of the page.

## From start to finish how does that data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

Creating an HTMl format, organizing the content into section, where they're going to be shown and laid out throughout the page, then "painting" the page with CSS. The DOM (document object model) shows the content and CSSOM (cascade stylesheet object model) shows the styling. Javascript plays the role when the user needs to create a specific function in the web page, for example when a user is going to provide the information under the contact nav-bar: it requires a specific function of importing and exporting data or information and holds that data into another computer.

## What code is rendered in the browser?

Hypertext Markup Link or HTML; when it display its content.

## What is the server-side code’s main function?

Gives or responds the information. Both client and server use HTTP to communicate to each other.

## What is the client-side code’s main function?

Asks or requests the information. Both client and server use HTTP to communicate to each other.

## How many instances of the client-side assets (HTML, CSS, JS, Images, etc.) are created?

It all matters how much data the client side wants to store. And can use these datas as much as they can. It's an instant whenever it runs or opens.

## How many instances of the server-side code are available at any given time?

Whenever the client request the information or data that they need.

## What is runtime?

It is when the program is running or being executed. In some languages, there are built-in or packaged libraries, where these programs have a set routine.

ex) computer starting up or loading an application.

## How many instances of the the databases connected to the server application are created?

At any given time. In an object-oriented programming (OOP), an instance is a specific realization of any object called instantiation. Each time the program starts or runs, it's the run-time of that instance.
