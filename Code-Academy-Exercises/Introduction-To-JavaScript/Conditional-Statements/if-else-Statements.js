let sale = true;

};



//the if alone is false, the code would get blocked and shows no result.
//For it to be exeuctued, we can add an else statement to let it run in order to evaluate to false.
// the if else statements allows to automate solutions to yes or no questions, knownw as binary deciiosn.
