//package.json file contains information below.

// Metadata — This includes a project title, description, authors, and more.
// A list of node packages required for the project — If another developer wants to run your project, npm looks inside package.json and downloads the packages in this list.
// Key-value pairs for command line scripts — You can use npm to run these shorthand scripts to perform some process. In a later exercise, we will add a script that runs Babel and transpiles ES6 to ES5.
