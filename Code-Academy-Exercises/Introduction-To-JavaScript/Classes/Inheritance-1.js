//When multiple classes share properties or methods, this is called inheritance â€” a tool developers use to decrease the amount of code they need to write.
//Create a parent class (also known as a superclass) with properties and methods that multiple child classes (also known as subclasses) share. The child classes inherit the properties and methods from their parent class.
